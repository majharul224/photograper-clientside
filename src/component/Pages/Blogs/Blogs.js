                    SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
                    databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
                    tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
                    that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

                  Question 2. What is JWT, and how does it work?

                    JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
                    information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT
                    contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
                    signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
                    cannot be altered after the token is issued. How works:JWTs differ
                    from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims
                    are used to transmit information between two parties. What these
                    claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may
                    assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what
                    permissions the client has been granted.

                  Question 3. What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?

                    JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
                    any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on
                    the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
                    JavaScript programming language.

                  Question 4. How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

                  <p>
                    NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
                    EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
                    architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
                    that receives requests and processes them.
